### Behavior

* Supported attachment types: `photo`, `gif`, `video`
* Each post contains link to the original message
* Media type priority: `gif` -> `video` -> `photo` (only one media type per post supported) 
* If the post contains either photo or gif, the text will be truncated to 1024 chars (telegram restriction)
* Video link pasted _as is_ and forwards to the VK (even if it's a youtube video)
